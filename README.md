## Why S-curve are important?

The S-curve shows the amount of work invested and the time in two ways: what was estimated in the planning and what was achieved, which allows the project to be compared and analyzed. In this way, it highlights deviations and is an important ally for:

  <ul>
      <li>Identifying the health of the project;</li>
      <li>Avoiding negative risks;</li>
      <li>Making more assertive decisions;</li>
      <li>Implement improvements during progress;</li>
      <li>Implement improvements during progress;</li>
